# Insurance Website Application

## Overview

This is a modern, full-stack insurance website built with React and Express that provides information about various insurance products and allows visitors to submit contact forms with document attachments. The application features a professional marketing website with sections for auto, home, and life insurance, along with a contact form that supports file uploads.

**Business Credentials**: The site emphasizes being a proud family-owned business with 14 years of experience serving thousands of clients across Florida. The touching family story (from humble Miami beginnings in 2011 to statewide expansion) is featured prominently on the About page, creating an emotional connection with visitors.

**Strategic Vision**: The company aims to transform into an enterprise-grade platform supporting 500+ employees and hundreds of thousands of clients. A dedicated strategic planning page at `/plans` outlines the expansion roadmap with 12+ initiatives across 4 phases, including growth metrics dashboards, AI chatbot integration, interactive Florida expansion maps, video testimonials, and enterprise-level features. The page includes collaborative functionality for adding custom client suggestions during presentations.

  - Error handling middleware
- **File Upload Processing**: Multer for handling multipart form data with file type validation
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot module replacement during development

### Data Storage Architecture
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore NoSQL database for scalable data storage (contact forms, carousel config)
- **File Storage**: 
  - Replit Object Storage (similar to AWS S3) for policy application documents
  - Firebase Storage for contact form attachments and images
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (configured for future admin features)
- **Schema Management**: 
  - TypeScript interfaces with Zod validation for type safety
  - Firestore collections for contact submissions and site configuration
  - Server-side image management through Firebase Admin SDK
- **Data Models**:
  - Contact submissions with file attachment URLs from Firebase Storage
  - Policy applications with document URLs from Object Storage
  - Carousel images configuration stored in Firestore
  - Site configuration and uploaded media tracking

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components organized by feature
- **UI System**: Comprehensive design system with shadcn/ui components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive utilities
- **Animation System**: 
  - Scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer API
  - Auto insurance page: Car crash animation on load with cartoon particle burst effect
  - Life insurance page: Heartbeat animation on heart icon (continuous double-beat pattern)
  - Home insurance page: House icon sways gently (protection/shelter effect)
  - Health insurance page: Icon pulses like a health monitor
  - Commercial insurance page: Building rises and falls (construction/growth effect)
- **Interactive Logo**: InsureIT logo serves as homepage link with engaging hover animations (scale, rotate shield, color transitions)

- **AI Assistant Chatbot "Liz"**: Interactive chatbot with:
  - **Insurance Type Selection First**: Shows clickable buttons (Auto/Home/Life) as first step, before collecting any personal data
  - **Page Navigation**: Clicking an insurance type navigates to that insurance page (e.g., /auto-insurance)
  - **Confirmation Before Data Collection**: Asks "Would you like to apply?" before collecting information
  - **Form-Like Chat Interface**: Input box always stays at bottom for familiar UX
  - **Multi-Step Application System**: Supports Auto, Home, and Life insurance applications
  - **Document Upload**: PDF/DOC/DOCX/JPG/PNG files up to 10MB via Replit Object Storage
