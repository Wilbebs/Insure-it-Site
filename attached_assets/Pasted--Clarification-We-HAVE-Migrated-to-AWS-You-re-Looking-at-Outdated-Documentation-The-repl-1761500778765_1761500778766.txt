# Clarification: We HAVE Migrated to AWS

## You're Looking at Outdated Documentation

The `replit.md` file you're referencing is **OUTDATED**. We have **already migrated** from Replit Object Storage to AWS S3 and from in-memory storage to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.

## Current Architecture (What Actually Exists NOW)

Please check the ACTUAL current files in the project:

### Backend Files (Check These):
1. **`/server/routes.ts`** - Contains `/api/contact` endpoint with S3 upload using multer-s3
2. **`/server/s3.ts`** - AWS S3 client configuration and multer-s3 setup
3. **`/server/db.ts`** - PostgreSQL connection using `pg` library
4. **`/db/schema.sql`** - PostgreSQL schema for contacts table
5. **`.env`** - Contains AWS credentials (AWS_REGION, S3_BUCKET_NAME, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL)

### Files That Should NOT Exist Anymore (Delete if Found):
- `/server/storage.ts` (old in-memory storage)
- `/server/objectStorage.ts` (old Replit Object Storage)
- Any code importing from `@replit/object-storage`

## What I Need You To Do

**STEP 1: Verify Current Architecture**
Look at the actual files in `/server/` directory right now:
- What files exist?
- Open `/server/routes.ts` - does it use multer-s3 and AWS S3?
- Open `/server/db.ts` - does it use PostgreSQL?
- Check if old storage files still exist

**STEP 2: If Old Files Exist**
- Delete `/server/storage.ts`
- Delete `/server/objectStorage.ts`
- Remove any imports of Replit Object Storage
- Remove any in-memory storage code

**STEP 3: Execute the Cleanup Tasks**
Once you've confirmed the current architecture, proceed with:
1. Rename landing page file to `landing.tsx` (currently `home-alternating.tsx`)
2. Remove duplicate home page files
3. Fix the "Get Quoted Today Now" button so it's clickable
4. Ensure file upload to S3 works correctly
5. Remove any other redundant files

## Stop Looking at `replit.md`

The `replit.md` file is documentation from an OLD version of the project. Ignore it completely. Look at the ACTUAL CODE FILES that exist right now.

## Answer These Questions:

1. Does `/server/routes.ts` currently have AWS S3 upload code? (Yes/No)
2. Does `/server/db.ts` currently have PostgreSQL connection code? (Yes/No)
3. Do old files `/server/storage.ts` or `/server/objectStorage.ts` still exist? (Yes/No)
4. What does the current `/api/contact` endpoint in `/server/routes.ts` actually do?

Please check the actual files and report back what you find, then we can proceed with the cleanup.
